# my-profound-app

Bootstrapped with [`create-profound-app`](https://github.com/tryprofound/hybrid-cms-template).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

CMS-backed routes are rendered through `src/app/[...slug]/page.tsx`. The base template ships with an
empty component registry, so custom CMS block types need to be registered before those routes render
meaningful content.

## Project Structure
